---

Testing was an ongoing process throughout the development of this project. From the early stages of building functionality to the final design refinements, a range of tools and techniques were used to ensure the application performs as expected.

Google Chrome Developer Tools were used extensively to test layout responsiveness, debug issues, and inspect elements across different screen sizes. Manual testing was also carried out on various devices to ensure the site functions smoothly on desktop, tablet, and mobile.

Automated tools such as Lighthouse and WAVE were used to assess accessibility, performance, and best practices, helping to improve the overall user experience.

## Validation Testing

### HTML Validation

HTML was validated using the [W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/). 

Since the project is built with Django, the remaining errors and warnings are related to the framework's template syntax and not the final rendered HTML.css

## Bugs

### Solved Bugs

### Solved Bugs

| No | Bug | How I solved the issue |
|:--:|:-----|:------------------------|
| 1 | Product images not displaying on the product detail page | Verified image URLs were correctly stored and used Cloudinary’s Django storage backend properly configured in settings. Cleared cache to refresh stale links. |
| 2 | Cart items disappearing after user logs out | Changed cart data storage from session-only to user-linked database model to persist items across sessions. |
| 3 | Checkout form validation errors not showing | Added explicit form error handling in the template and ensured that validation errors were passed correctly from the backend to the frontend. |
| 4 | Email confirmations not being sent after registration | Configured Django email backend with correct SMTP settings, and tested email sending with console backend before switching to production SMTP. |
| 5 | Pagination not working on product listing page | Fixed queryset slicing logic and added proper page number parameter handling in views and templates. |
| 6 | Search results not including newly added products | Implemented database commit after product creation and added cache invalidation logic to ensure search indexes are updated. |
| 7 | Mobile layout breaking on smaller screens | Tweaked Bootstrap 4 grid classes and custom CSS media queries to improve responsiveness and fix overlapping elements. |
